Cons: The major down side is battery charging time, battery life and built in storage space. When it arrived, it was showing 76% remaining. After less than 2.5 hours use, it had to be charged. I just read where it can take 6 hours or longer to charge. My iPad Air 2 can fully charge in a few hours from 0%. Built in storage is not enough. Yes you can get micro SD cards however some apps will only install on the built in storage. Also, you can not delete Amazon apps without voiding the warranty.

This one Umm...not so much.PROS:- I really like the solution Amazon came up with to lock the Kindle in place sort of a rubberized cup that grips it on all four sides and holds it VERY securely. No more metal-prong slide-release gizmo.- It looks quite nice and is genuine (if untextured) leather like the last one.CONS:- Flimsy. The leather is extremely thin and unpadded. Won't stand up to much abuse. scrape it even lightly on a rough surface and you'll likely ruin it.- The actual cover that folds over the front is incredibly floppy and delicate -- it's about the thickness of a piece of notepad cardboard. I could bend it in half with almost no effort, if I had the notion.- Cover has no lock/closure mechanism (like the elastic strap on the last gen model). It should have SOMETHING.Oh, well.

My husband did this and cracked the Kindle frame within the first week of owning the device. Fortunately, only the frame was cracked and the Kindle still works. We cannot, however, remove the cover because of the way it hooks into the device, the hook closure must be bent because of the accidental attempt to open the back cover. After the incident, we attempted to clip the back cover to the Kindle, but found this to be cumbersome and the clip would not stay in place.

So we bought them each a brand new Kindle in order to use the app. They had Kindles from earlier years, but these wouldn\\'t support the Bluetooth functionality needed for the robots.ABSOLUTE FAIL. We tried EVERY possible configuration (adult vs child Amazon accounts; Bluetooth on first or off first; MiP on first or off first; etc). It never worked at all ~ not even once.Also tried full factory reset on each device, loading the app via a Google Play account, rather than Amazon Kindle account. Google Play wouldn\\'t load the app; said it wasn\\'t compatible with this Kindle device.Opened a ticket on WowWee. The response was that they\\'ve had the same experience - the bluetooth on this Kindle fails and so the app doesn\\'t work with the WowWee robots.

You can fold the leather cover back to have the 'one page' feel of just the Kindle in your hand, or you can leave it open and then the Kindle reads more like an unfolded book.2 protection on the inside and good to hold for longer periods of timeThe inside is soft to protect the screen, and the outside is real leather - which is a plus to rubber which tends to make the hands more sticky after a while.3 The weight is neglegible the item is very light.4 The hinge system prevents the Kindle to slip out, which no other cover that I know of has5 Elastic band keeps the cover together and indicates 'front' of the device. Many people have complained before that when one opens the Kindle on the back unintentionally, the Kindle could crack at the hinges. By closing it up with the elastic band, you always know where the front is so you never have this problemCON's1 Expensive. That is why I bought it from overstock.com from the marketplace amazon, rather than new from amazon itself2 No total protection. Only an Otterbox case will make sure the Kindle survives a fall on the ground. But for both cases you still need a plastic screen cover to keep the Kindle clean and untouched.Overall If reading comfort is firt priority, and you are careful enough not to damage the Kindle, this is the product for you. If you rather want more safety from damage or scratches, go for the Otterbox, but then the comfortable feel will be compromised for a more heave, rubber 'touch'.\",\n",

The leather is high quality (it has that wonderful new smell as well) and has beautiful stitching around the border on the front. The case does not add any bulk to the Kindle. I find it quite comfortable to hold in one hand or two, as the front cover folds behind the case, and I truly feel like I am holding an actual book while reading.At the top of the case, there is a plastic arm that pulls upward to reveal a light, which illuminates the screen of the Kindle perfectly in a dark room. My eyes have no trouble reading with the light activated. The light is powered by the Kindle itself, by way of two metal prongs inside the case making contact with two metal tabs on the lower back of the Kindle. The arm for the light does seem a bit delicate, and I could see a young child inadvertently breaking this if care is not shown. I fear that over time, this will be the first piece to stop functioning as the case is regularly used.My only criticism of this case is that there is no way to secure the front cover from opening. It would have been nice to include a clasp, or some kind of stretchable band to keep the case closed. I paid 54 for this case, which is almost as expensive as the Kindle itself. At that price, the designers should have had the forethought to include a means of securing the case from opening. Aside from this potential problem, this Kindle case is perfect, and adds a bit of sophistication to an already awesome device.Kudos, Amazon!',\n",

I use this device for watching Live TV from PlayStation Vue (much cheaper than cable or satellite TV). I like the Fire TV box much better than the Fire TV stick....it's more stable and stronger (has quad core processor, the stick is dual core). If you have strong wifi the stick maybe okay, I kept experiencing buffering issues with the stick. The Fire TV box has an Ethernet port, mini SD slot, and USB port (the stick doesn't). You will need to setup an Amazon account to use the device, but you don't have to put credit card information on it if you don't want to. I didn't give it 5 stars because it is extremely difficult to put batteries in the remote control - VERY difficult to open it. Despite that, IMO, it's worth the extra cost.\",\n",

Unlike the Kindle Fire, obviously, it is not a good choice for browsing the web or reading e-mail. Navigation between books is not as easy as I would like; a half screen of 6 recent books, with the other half taken up by \"recommended\" books is not as handy as a full-screen text list of my books would be. But the actual process of reading is easy, and there are a few tools for note taking and seeing how frequently other people highlight sections of text.

Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite.\",\n",
